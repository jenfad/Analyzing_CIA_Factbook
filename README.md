# Analyzing_CIA_Factbook
## using SQLite and Pandas in Python

The following is part of the Dataquest description of the project:

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information.

You can download the SQLite database, factbook.db, from this GitHub repo (https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases) if you want to work with it on your own computer. In this guided project, we'll explore the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database. 

Here are the descriptions for some of the columns:

name - The name of the country.
area - The total land and sea area of the country.
population - The country's population [as of 2015].
population_growth- The country's population growth as a percentage.
